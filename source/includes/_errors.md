# Errors

We have developed a set of error codes, destined to provide you with helpful information when integrating Distribusion API. We categorised them into three main types: 

- `400` - [Client errors](https://api-demo.distribusion.com/retailers/v3/docs/#client-errors) 

- `500` - [Server errors](https://api-demo.distribusion.com/retailers/v3/docs/#server-errors) 

- `600` - [Remote server errors](https://api-demo.distribusion.com/retailers/v3/docs/#remote-server-errors).
