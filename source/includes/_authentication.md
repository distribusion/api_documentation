Distribusion uses API keys to allow access to the API content and perform bookings. You can register a new Distribusion API key by contacting us at [partner@distribusion.com](mailto:partner@distribusion.com).

Distribusion expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Api-Key:AIzaSyBGEpZdxbufTSpcIxWXoRjSdKu6ZctiuyI`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>AIzaSyBGEpZdxbufTSpcIxWXoRjSdKu6ZctiuyI</code> with your own API key.
